# 0.8.1

* Update rand_core for [RUSTSEC-2021-0023](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0023).

# 0.8.0

This is a backwards breaking change in the crate.

* Redesigned the Engine API. It now requires an instance of a struct that implements the
  rpick::ui::UI trait. This trait provides a more natural way to interact with the library than
  streams of bytes.
* The Engine and its Error have been moved into a `rpick::engine` module.
* The configuration structs, enums, and functions have been moved into a `rpick::config` module.
* The Engine `ValueError` struct was replaced by a new `PickError` enum.
* Updated dependencies.

* [#5](https://gitlab.com/bowlofeggs/rpick/merge_requests/5): Introduced a unit test suite.
* [#8](https://gitlab.com/bowlofeggs/rpick/merge_requests/8): Defined a library for rpick so
  integrators can write their own front end to it. This also aided in testing.

  Documented installation.


# 0.2.0

* [#3](https://gitlab.com/bowlofeggs/rpick/merge_requests/3): Added a new ```even``` distribution
  model, which does a nice flat random pick.
* [#4](https://gitlab.com/bowlofeggs/rpick/merge_requests/4): Added a new ```weighted```
